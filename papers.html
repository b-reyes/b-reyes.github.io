                    <h3>> "The Wrath of KAN: Enabling Fast, Accurate, and Transparent Emulation of the Global 21 cm Cosmology Signal"</h3>
                    <div class="preview-window">
                        <p>
                            <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of the global 
                            21 cm cosmology signal, 21cmKAN, that provides extremely fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent 
                            accuracy to the most accurate emulator to date, 21cmLSTM. The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy 
                            facilitated by 21cmKAN enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 
                            21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust 
                            constraints on the early Universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like 
                            traditional fully connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly 
                            better for low-dimensional physical problems. 21cmKAN predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the 
                            community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than 21cmLSTM, when utilizing the same typical GPU. 
                            In addition, 21cmKAN is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its 
                            relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that 21cmKAN required 
                            less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find 
                            that the transparent architecture of 21cmKAN allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation 
                            results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the 
                            effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison 
                            to other types of neural networks.

                            <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> As demand for computational power grows, access to advanced 
                            cyberinfrastructure (CI) and the professionals needed to support it has become increasingly 
                            critical. However, hiring and retaining cyberinfrastructure professionals (CIPs) remains a 
                            significant challenge, as many trained in enterprise services lack the specialized skills 
                            required for advanced CI administration. To address this gap, a student cohort program was 
                            implemented via the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC), providing hands-on 
                            training in CI administration. The program included weekly virtual sessions, mentorship, and two 
                            in-person experiences where students participated in real-world system deployment and decommissioning 
                            tasks. Students gained practical experience in Slurm configuration, Linux proficiency, hardware procurement, 
                            and system troubleshooting. This initiative has proven highly successful, offering professional 
                            development opportunities and expanding the pipeline of skilled CIPs. The results emphasize the 
                            importance of integrating CI administration education into research computing programs to ensure the 
                            sustainability and growth of advanced CI support.

                            <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> Computationally quantifying uncertainties in the mathematical modeling of physical 
                            processes is crucial for understanding the errors induced by both numerical approximations of the model and 
                            lack of precise input data assumed in the continuous model. Uncertain input parameters in the continuous model 
                            are typically treated as random variables, leading to the need to consider solutions of both the continuous and 
                            discrete models as stochastic processes. Computing statistical moments of the stochastic processes is an extremely 
                            important part of the uncertainty quantification problem. In this work, we consider a class of physical processes 
                            that are modeled by the Allen-Cahn (A-C) partial differential equation (PDE) evolutionary system, with uncertainties 
                            in the initial state of the evolution and the A-C PDE. We develop a hybrid computational model for the stochastic 
                            A-C system to efficiently compute statistical moments of the numerical counterparts of the A-C stochastic processes. 
                            The hybrid framework comprises finite element method in-space approximations, high-order digital nets based sampling 
                            in high dimensional probability space, and an interplay of discretization parameters in the spatial and stochastic 
                            approximations. We demonstrate marked efficiency of the hybrid framework, compared to the standard methods, using 
                            two- and three-dimensional in space and high stochastic dimensional A-C example systems.

                        <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Background</strong>
                        <br>
                        Theoretical analysis of signaling pathways can provide a substantial amount of insight into their 
                        function. One particular area of research considers signaling pathways capable of assuming two or more stable states given 
                        the same amount of signaling ligand. This phenomenon of bistability can give rise to switch-like behavior, a mechanism that 
                        governs cellular decision making. Investigation of whether or not a signaling pathway can confer bistability and switch-like 
                        behavior, without knowledge of specific kinetic rate constant values, is a mathematically challenging problem. Recently a 
                        technique based on optimization has been introduced, which is capable of finding example parameter values that confer 
                        switch-like behavior for a given pathway. Although this approach has made it possible to analyze moderately sized pathways, 
                        it is limited to reaction networks that presume a uniterminal structure. It is this limited structure we address by developing 
                        a general technique that applies to any mass action reaction network with conservation laws.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Results</strong>
                        <br>
                        In this paper we developed a generalized method for detecting switch-like bistable behavior in any mass action reaction 
                        network with conservation laws. The method involves (1) construction of a constrained optimization problem using the 
                        determinant of the Jacobian of the underlying rate equations, (2) minimization of the objective function to search for 
                        conditions resulting in a zero eigenvalue, (3) computation of a confidence level that describes if the global minimum has 
                        been found and (4) evaluation of optimization values, using either numerical continuation or directly simulating the ODE 
                        system, to verify that a bistability region exists. The generalized method has been tested on three motifs known to be 
                        capable of bistability.

                        <strong>Conclusions</strong>
                        <br>
                        We have developed a variation of an optimization-based method for the discovery of bistability, which is not limited to 
                        uniterminal chemical reaction networks. Successful completion of the method provides an S-shaped bifurcation diagram, 
                        which indicates that the network acts as a bistable switch for the given optimization parameters.

                            systems (polymer melts and suspensions of particles) in shear flow between two parallel plates using only 
                            velocity measurements from numerical simulations. The PINN-inferred viscosity models agree with empirical models 
                            for shear rates with large absolute values but deviate for shear rates near zero where empirical models have an 
                            unphysical singularity. We show that once the unknown physics is learned the PINN method can be used to solve the 
                            momentum conservation equation governing flow of non-Newtonian fluids.

                        <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Motivation</strong>
                        <br>
                        Signaling pathways capable of switching between two states are ubiquitous 
                        within living organisms. They provide the cells with the means to produce reversible or irreversible 
                        decisions. Switch-like behavior of biological systems is realized through biochemical reaction networks 
                        capable of having two or more distinct steady states, which are dependent on initial conditions. 
                        Investigation of whether a certain signaling pathway can confer bistability involves a substantial amount 
                        of hypothesis testing. The cost of direct experimental testing can be prohibitive. Therefore, constraining 
                        the hypothesis space is highly beneficial. One such methodology is based on chemical reaction network theory 
                        (CRNT), which uses computational techniques to rule out pathways that are not capable of bistability regardless 
                        of kinetic constant values and molecule concentrations. Although useful, these methods are complicated from both 
                        pure and computational mathematics perspectives. Thus, their adoption is very limited amongst biologists.

                        <strong>Results</strong>
                        <br>
                        We brought CRNT approaches closer to experimental biologists by automating all the necessary steps in CRNT4SMBL. 
                        The input is based on systems biology markup language (SBML) format, which is the community standard for biological 
                        pathway communication. The tool parses SBML and derives C-graph representations of the biological pathway with mass
                        action kinetics. Next steps involve an efficient search for potential saddle-node bifurcation points using an 
                        optimization technique. This type of bifurcation is important as it has the potential of acting as a switching point 
                        between two steady states. Finally, if any bifurcation points are present, continuation analysis with respect to a 
                        user-defined parameter extends the steady state branches and generates a bifurcation diagram. Presence of an S-shaped 
                        bifurcation diagram indicates that the pathway acts as a bistable switch for the given optimization parameters.

                            <strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> We consider a moving shutter and non-deterministic generalization 
                            of the diffraction in time model introduced by Moshinsky several decades ago to study a class 
                            of quantum transients. We first develop a moving-mesh finite element method (FEM) to simulate 
                            the determisitic version of the model. We then apply the FEM and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) 
                            algorithm to the stochastic moving-domain model for simulation of approximate statistical moments 
                            of the density profile of the stochastic transients.
